# Second Life Issues

This repo serves as a public space for coordination between **Second Life developers and open source contributors** for all issues that do not coorespond with a specific repository (such as [secondlife/viewer](https://github.com/secondlife/viewer).)

> **Please Note:** This is **not** the place to file general feature requests or bug reports.

## 🚫 Filing Feature Requests or Bugs?

Please submit all user-facing bugs, feature ideas, and UI feedback to our community portal:

👉 [feedback.secondlife.com](https://feedback.secondlife.com)

This repository is **only for work that has already been accepted** and is ready for collaborative engineering.

## ✅ What Goes Here

- Issues that represent **engineering tasks**
- Projects with active **bounties**, using the [Opire platform](https://opire.dev)
- Discussions and clarifications on **scoped technical work**
- Coordination between **Linden Lab developers** and **external contributors**

For more details on how our bounty program works, see our [BOUNTY.md](./BOUNTY.md) guide.
